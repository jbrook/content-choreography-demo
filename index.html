			<h3>(main)</h3>
			<p>
				Using flexbox and box-ordinal-group CSS properties, <strong>we can change the order</strong>
				of elements on a page at different viewport sizes. The numbered labels represent the order
				in which the content appears in the code - resize your browser to see them change if you are
				on a desktop.
			</p>
			<p>
				This example is built on the principles of <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/mobile/the-
				many-faces-of-mobile-first/">mobile first</a> and <a href="http://goldilocksapproach.com">
				The Goldilocks Approach</a>. There are two break-points, one at approximately 33em and
				another when there is room to display multiple columns. The first breakpoint changes back to 
				the old CSS box model (display:block).
			</p>
			<p>	
				CSS Flexbox (2009 spec) is not very widely supported by browsers but, conveniently, is widely
				supported by the most used mobile and tablet browsers. It's on those devices where we might
				want to choreograph the content.

			<h3>(aside)</h3>
			<p>
				This example has been built with SASS, Compass and the 'Susy' responsive grid plugin. The 
				mark-up remains semantic and the grid is 'em' based.
			</p>
			<p>	
				Finally, some attention has been paid to typography, golden ratios, vertical rhythm, and
				modular scale.
